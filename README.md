# NLPeek - Browser Extension

NLPeek is a browser extension that provides link summarization using AI. When you hover over a link, a tooltip appears showing a summary of the linked content. The extension is built with React and TypeScript, using the WXT framework.

## How It Works

The summarization feature is powered by an AI backend that processes the content of the links and generates concise summaries. The backend service is not included in this repository and is being worked on.
